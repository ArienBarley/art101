				<h4>Challenge</h4>
				<p>
					Create functions that use conditional statements. Specifically make a hash function based on the name to make the sorting more mysterious but still reliable based on the input. I also decided to include a few other experiments in this lab.
					I have finally experimented more with css and made some animations with css, to make the buttons a bit overwhelming.
					I also wanted to learn to read and write files, so decided to store peoples name and house in a text file to learn to do this.
				</p>

			<div class = "task">
				<h4>Problems</h4>
				<p>
					I decided to try to add some animations to the buttons to get a sense of how css animations work.<br>
					At first they weren't working, I tested if the hover event was being triggered with:<br>
					<pre>
		function test(){
			console.log('hover triggered')
		}
		$('button').hover(test);
					</pre>
					Next I tested it on a div, which worked. I think Maybe the problem is that buttons already have a hover animation by default.
				</p>
				<p>
					Learning to get files was more complicated. <br>
					After a bit of stack overflow research I found that an XML (extensible markup language) request was needed just to read the data from the same directory as the js file. <br>
					After setting this up I found that Chrome does not allow files to access other files on the computer without restarting it from terminal with --allow-file-access-from-files. I decided to try testing it on the github page.
					Using the console I found that the function was reading the data off but not returning it because I forgot that the variables created outside of the anonymous function weren't accessible from within it. I solved this by creating a global variable to hold this value. This solution, however, does feel clunky and I would like to know what best practice for managing global variables is in javascript.

				<p class="caption"> Here's some of the console experiments</p>
				<p>I was going to also try to have each input write to the file. It looks like the proper way of doing this is with nodeJS and fetch rather than an XMLHttpRequest, but its gone midnight and this is due at 7am so I'll work that out another time. For now I just put some harry potter data to demo the function</p>
				<p>
					I also noticed that the button doesnt  display the data the first time it's pressed. I think this is because this line: <br> $('#output-3').html('pre'+data+'/pre') <br>
					runs before the data is returned and the 'onload' function is run when the request comes back.

				<h4>Results</h4>

				<p>Input your name:<p>
				<input id = 'user-name' type = 'text' value='John Smith'>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'find-house'>find out what your house is the basic way</button>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'find-house-hash'>find out what your house is the unnecesarily complicated way</button>
				<div id = 'output-1' class = "js-output">
					<p>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>Gimme a number</p>
				<input id = 'usernumber' type = 'number' value=123>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'div-3'>is ur number divisible by 3</button>
				<div id = 'output-2' class = "js-output">
					<p>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>See other people's houses</p>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'reveal-house-affiliation'>see some harry potter data</button>
