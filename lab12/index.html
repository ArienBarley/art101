				<h4>Challenge</h4>
				<p>
					Create functions that use conditional statements. Specifically make a hash function based on the name to make the sorting more mysterious but still reliable based on the input. I also decided to include a few other experiments in this lab.
					I have finally experimented more with css and made some animations with css, to make the buttons a bit overwhelming.
					I also wanted to learn to read and write files, so decided to store peoples name and house in a text file to learn to do this.

				<h4>Problems</h4>
				<p>
					I decided to try to add some animations to the buttons to get a sense of how css animations work.<br>
					At first they weren't working, I tested if the hover event was being triggered with:<br>
					<pre>
		function test(){
			console.log('hover triggered')
		}
		$('button').hover(test);
					</pre>
					Next I tested it on a div, which worked. I think Maybe the problem is that buttons already have a hover animation by default.
				</p>
				<p>
					Learning to get files was more complicated. <br>
					After a bit of stack overflow research I found that an XML (extensible markup language) request was needed just to read the data from the same directory as the js file. <br>
					After setting this up I found that Chrome does not allow files to access other files on the computer without restarting it from terminal with --allow-file-access-from-files. I decided to try testing it on the github page.

				<h4>Results</h4>

				<p>Input your name:<p>
				<input id = 'user-name' type = 'text' value='John Smith'>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'find-house'>find out what your house is the basic way</button>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'find-house-hash'>find out what your house is the unnecesarily complicated way</button>
				<div id = 'output-1' class = "js-output">
					<p>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>Gimme a number</p>
				<input id = 'usernumber' type = 'number' value=123>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'div-3'>is ur number divisible by 3</button>
				<div id = 'output-2' class = "js-output">
					<p>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>See other people's houses</p>
				<button class = 'btn' id = 'reveal-house-affiliation'>See house asignments</button>
