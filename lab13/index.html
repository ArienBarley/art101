				<h4>Problems</h4>
				<p>
					Having used loops a lot in the past labs and in python I didn't run into many problems with this lab (other than forgetting to submit it until now). One problem I did run into was the loop not terminating if the limit was 6 or greater, this was confusing. By writing i to the console I found that i, the variable name I was using to control the outer for loop to check each numbers factors <b> and </b> to control the loop that checked if a number was prime was re-setting to 5 each time it reached 7. I realised this was because I declared the for loop as: for ( i = 1; i<=n; i++) rather than for (var i = 1; i<=n; i++) which caused i to be a global variable and the i that was stepping through the numbers up to the user defined limit was being overwritten by the i from isPrime.
