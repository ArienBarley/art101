					<h3>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h3>
					<p><u>Learning to use JavaScript's arrays and objects</u></p>
					
					<p>It was interesting learning how to use objects and functions in JavaScript and see how knowledge from Java and Python transferred (and how it didn’t). I enjoyed creating a function to print out the information in a more readable format than JSON.stringify() as well as getting familiar with arrays and accessing object’s variables and functions. It took a bit of googling and trying things out but I enjoyed the process.</p>

					<p>As the this_destination was picked at random each time write_self() was called it may have been better practice to use an initialiser function to create an instance of a myMainRide rather than just having the object print out a random destination but I didn’t feel I had time to keep fiddling with the script.</p>
