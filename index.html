						<h5>Chapter 1</h5>
						The tao that can be described
						is not the eternal Tao.
						The name that can be spoken
						is not the eternal Name.
						The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth.
						The named is the mother of creation.
						Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery.
						By having desire, you can only see what is visibly real.
						Yet mystery and reality
						emerge from the same source.
						This source is called darkness.
						Darkness born from darkness.
						The beginning of all understanding.
						<h5>Chapter 2</h5>
						When people see things as beautiful,
						ugliness is created.
						When people see things as good,
						evil is created.
						Being and non-being produce each other.
						Difficult and easy complement each other.
						Long and short define each other.
						High and low oppose each other.
						Fore and aft follow each other.
						Therefore the Master
						can act without doing anything
						and teach without saying a word.
						Things come her way and she does not stop them;
						things leave and she lets them go.
						She has without possessing,
						and acts without any expectations.
						When her work is done, she takes no credit.
						That is why it will last forever.
						<h5>Chapter 3</h5>
						If you overly esteem talented individuals,
						people will become overly competitive.
						If you overvalue possessions,
						people will begin to steal.
						Do not display your treasures
						or people will become envious.
						The Master leads by
						emptying people's minds;
						filling their bellies,
						weakening their ambitions,
						and making them become strong.
						Preferring simplicity and freedom from desires,
						avoiding the pitfalls of knowledge and wrong action.
						For those who practice not-doing,
						everything will fall into place.
						<h5>Chapter 4</h5>
						The Tao is like an empty container:
						it can never be emptied and can never be filled.
						Infinitely deep, it is the source of all things.
						It dulls the sharp, unties the knotted,
						shades the lighted, and unites all of creation with dust.
						It is hidden but always present.
						I don't know who gave birth to it .
						It is older than the concept of God.
						<h5>Chapter 5</h5>
						Heaven and Earth are impartial;
						they treat all of creation as straw dogs.
						The Master doesn't take sides;
						she treats everyone like a straw dog.
						The space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows;
						it is empty, yet has not lost its power.
						The more it is used, the more it produces;
						the more you talk of it, the less you comprehend.
						It is better not to speak of things you do not understand.
						<h5>Chapter 6</h5>
						The spirit of emptiness is immortal.
						It is called the Great Mother
						because it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.
						It is like a vapor,
						barely seen but always present.
						Use it effortlessly.
						<h5>Chapter 7</h5>
						The Tao of Heaven is eternal,
						and the earth is long enduring.
						Why are they long enduring?
						They do not live for themselves;
						thus they are present for all beings.
						The Master puts herself last;
						And finds herself in the place of authority.
						She detaches herself from all things;
						Therefore she is united with all things.
						She gives no thought to self.
						She is perfectly fulfilled.
						<h5>Chapter 8</h5>
						The supreme good is like water,
						which benefits all of creation
						without trying to compete with it.
						It gathers in unpopular places.
						Thus it is like the Tao.
						The location makes the dwelling good.
						Depth of understanding makes the mind good.
						A kind heart makes the giving good.
						Integrity makes the government good.
						Accomplishments make your labors good.
						Proper timing makes a decision good.
						Only when there is no competition
						will we all live in peace.
						<h5>Chapter 9</h5>
						It is easier to carry an empty cup
						than one that is filled to the brim.
						The sharper the knife
						the easier it is to dull.
						The more wealth you possess
						the harder it is to protect.
						Pride brings it's own trouble.
						When you have accomplished your goal
						simply walk away.
						This is the pathway to Heaven.
						<h5>Chapter 10</h5>
						Nurture the darkness of your soul
						until you become whole.
						Can you do this and not fail?
						Can you focus your life-breath until you become
						supple as a newborn child?
						While you cleanse your inner vision
						will you be found without fault?
						Can you love people and lead them
						without forcing your will on them?
						When Heaven gives and takes away
						can you be content with the outcome?
						When you understand all things
						can you step back from your own understanding?
						Giving birth and nourishing,
						making without possessing,
						expecting nothing in return.
						To grow, yet not to control:
						This is the mysterious virtue.
						<h5>Chapter 11</h5>
						Thirty spokes are joined together in a wheel,
						but it is the center hole
						that allows the wheel to function.
						We mold clay into a pot,
						but it is the emptiness inside
						that makes the vessel useful.
						We fashion wood for a house,
						but it is the emptiness inside
						that makes it livable.
						We work with the substantial,
						but the emptiness is what we use.
						<h5>Chapter 12</h5>
						Five colors blind the eye.
						Five notes deafen the ear.
						Five flavors make the palate go stale.
						Too much activity deranges the mind.
						Too much wealth causes crime.
						The Master acts on what she feels and not what she sees.
						She shuns the latter, and prefers to seek the former.
						<h5>Chapter 13</h5>
						Success is as dangerous as failure,
						and we are often our own worst enemy.
						What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?
						He who is superior is also someone's subordinate.
						Receiving favor and loosing it both cause alarm.
						That is what is meant by success is as dangerous as failure.
						What does it mean that we are often our own worst enemy?
						The reason I have an enemy is because I have "self".
						If I no longer had a "self", I would no longer have an enemy.
						Love the whole world as if it were your self;
						then you will truly care for all things.
