				   I got very destracted making a noughts and crosses game
 				   instead of sorting characters in someone's name,
 				   this used up a lot of time I don't have but I learned a
 				   lot in the process. <br>
 				   I ran into problems that the page wouldnt load properly
 				   while the game loop was running and that using
 				   document.write() after the page had loaded overwrote the
 				   whole page, so I had to directly write to a div.
 				   Also I found that if the script was referenced inside
 				   the html it wasnt able to find the button objects, but
 				   it could when placed outside of the body tags.
 				   I would have liked to add a MiniMax algorithm to play
 				   against but that would probably take too long...<br>
 				   Probably...<br>
				   <br>
				   I also had some probems setting up the user input as a form
				   for the name intut as I was unfamiliar with the way form data
				   is stored, but w3schools sorted me out.<br>
				   For the shuffle algorithm I got some help from stack overflow
				   to save time and energy.<br>
				   I  could have had the JavaScript output a div styled in css
				   but I need to work on other classes NOW!<br>
